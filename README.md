# SetScreenResolution #

SetScreenResolution is a small Windows utility to change the Desktop screen resolution via the command line. For example, to set the resolution to 1080p, you would run:

    SetScreenResolution 1920 1080


## Warning ##

Driver permitting, the resolution is changed immediately and no prompt to ensure the change occurred correctly is provided. If you change the resolution to one unsupported by your system, you may have trouble changing it back.

It is strongly recommended that you test any resolution you'd like to use via the standard Windows display settings dialog at least once before proceeding.
